8007,In the report it was also mentioned that the PMR shows that Raishuddin had suffered abrasions all over his body and only one lacerated wound was there in his entire body that too in his hand which substantiates the point that death took place due to loss of blood after the cutting of the hand in an accident caused by rickshaw carrying steel sheets and not by the car.
8008,"

 The findings recorded above clearly show that it is not that the plaintiff was sleeping over the matter."
8009,It is held that the Collector is not 'Court' and the provisions of Section 4 to Section 24 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable to the proceedings under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act under which the Collector exercises powers for making reference to the Court.

8023,This arbitrary classification of putting the lawyers under the head of 'commercial activity' deserves to be struck down asviolativeof Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
8024,The Tribunal disposed of these issues together holding that the agricultural land in dispute and the Muafi belong to the Dera but the building situate in Patti Sujja mentioned at Serial No. 337 of Schedule I of the Act is the property of Gurdwara Sahib Dera Patti Sujja.

8039,"The expression "" current repairs "" was construed by the Allahabad High Court in Ramkishan Sunderlal v. CIT [1952] 19 ITR 324, as petty recurring expenditure."
8040,"Hence, the phrase ""he has regularly appeared as member of a trade union for no less than seven years in the proceedings"", used in Section 9(2)(b), in context of other provisions of the BIR Act, would mean that the person must have appeared and conducted regularly some cases as a representative of the employees before the Labour Court, the Industrial Court or the Tribunal for not less than seven years."

8758,"At the same examination, H.N. Shah, respondent No. 4, who was an officiating Deputy Engineer, also appeared and was appointed a Deputy Engineer as a direct recruit and his name appeared in the list below the petitioners."
8759,"Reading the overall evidence on record there is no sufficient evidence of strained relations between deceased and respondent No.3 to such an extent that deceased could have excluded him from the bequeath of immovable property of deceased in Will Ex.PW1/H.

8760,"Section 67: ""Act 8 of 1897 and certain provisions of Act 5 of H89i8 not to apply: (1) The Reformatory Schools Act, 1897 (Central Act No. 8 of 1897) and Section 29B and Section 399 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Central Act No. 5 of 1898)."
8761,It cannot be said that assignments or transfers of statutory tenancies are inconceivable.
8762,"However, as was pointed out by Bhagwati, J., under the Agricultural Income-tax Act a ""person"" included an individual."
8763,"The Tribunal is competent to adjudicate all matters relating to levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax and matters incidental and ancillary thereto, under the specified State Acts mentioned in the Schedule to the Taxation Tribunal Act, which includes the Bengal Excise Act, 1909."

8765,"The claimants are entitled to total compensation of Rs.3,75,000/- (Rs.2,25,000/- + Rs.75,000/- + Rs.75,000/-)."""
8766,"The petition under Arts. 226 and 227 made, as aforesaid, by the first respondent was heard by a single Judge (Mr. Justice V. R. Sen) who by his orders dated December 13, 1954, discharged the rule with costs."
8767,"The facts of the prosecution case as narrated at the trial by Raj Kumar, the star witness of the prosecution, were as follows:
 Raj Kumar had installed a Tubewell in his field known as 'Chharelawala.field' in the revenue estate of village Sant Kuiyan, in the year 1962."
8768,"Also, the Learned counsel for the Petitioners take a plea that the Learned Judicial Magistrate, Valliyoor has treated the First Respondent/Wife as a Complainant and has applied the ingredients of Section 200 Cr.P.C., when he examined her."
8769,"Hindu Law also applies to non-Hindus like Khojas and Cutchi Memons of Bombay and to Sunni Borahs of Gujrat and Molesalam Girasias of Broach, in matters of inheritance and succession."
8770,"As noted by me earlier, the first proviso to section 147 can be resorted to only if the assessee has not discharged the duty."
8771,It therefore emerges that non-compliance of these provisions i.e. Sections 100 and 165 CrPC would amount to an irregularity and the effect of the same on the main case depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
8772,"Nevertheless if precedent is needed for the proposition, it is available in the authoritative exposition by Subba Rao J. (as his Lordship then was) after an exhaustive discussion in CIT v. Malayalam Plantations Ltd. [1964] 53 ITR 140 (SC) in the following terms (p. 150):"
8773,"In Hamsa Vs.  Ibrahim (1994(1) Crimes 395 (Kerala) case,  it  has been held by Justice K.T.Thomas as follows:-

        ""According  to the law of England ""every person who is sui juris has a right to appoint an agent for any purpose whatever and that he can do so  when he  is  exercising  a  statutory  right no less than when he is exercising any other right""."
8774,"Earlier the accused was convicted vide judgment dated 23rd August, 1999 delivered in Sessions Trial No.325/1994 by Sessions Judge Morena for commission of the offence under section 302 IPC and awarded life imprisonment."
8775,Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is in custody since 21.01.2015.
8776,"Equally important is the deplorable condition, verging on the inhuman, of our sub-jails, that the unrewarding cruelty and expensive custody of avoidable incarceration makes refusal of bail unreasonable and a policy favouring release justly sensible."
8777,"Apparently, in view of reservation expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in regard to the cases of Kishun Singh (supra) and Nisar (supra) in the case of Raj Kishore Prasad (supra), the question was referred for consideration to a larger bench and it is in this background, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has expressed itself in the case of Ranjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 1998(4) RCR (Criminal) 552 (SC)."
8778,"In the assessment of compensation, there is likely to be some margin of error."
8779,"The rule, however, is not a universal one and under certain circumstances, such an amendment may be allowed by the court notwithstanding the law of limitation."
8780,"In support of his submission, he referred to another two Judge Bench decision in Kalpanath Rai vs. State (Through CBI) [(1997) 8 SCC 732] where this Court said that confession under Section 15 of TADA cannot be used as substantive evidence and that it has only corroborative value."
8781,"In Petition No. 375 of 1953 there are five petitioners of whom the first is Messrs. Allen Berry & Co., Ltd., second Asia Udyog Ltd., the third Shri R. K. Dalmia, the fourth the Secretary and General Attorney of the third and the fifth a shareholder of petitioners Nos. 1 and 2, and an officer of petitioner No. 2."
8782,Granting bail by the Judge without considering the order of dismissal passed by the other Judge is an impropriety and it is liable to be set- aside.
8783,"The Rules were subsequently amended by the Railway Protection (Amendment) Rules, 1973 (here in after to be referred as 'the Amendment Rules') promulgated by Notification dated' September 20, 1973, published in the Gazette of India dated September 20, 1973."
8784,"Amongst the matters covered by Section 6 (2) is the levy and collection of royalties, fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated or collected."
8785,"On the other hand, it was urged by learned counsel for the petitioner with reference to the sentence."
8786,"However, learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon decision reported in 2008 (3) TAC page 483 in which the question for consideration was whether Insurance Company is liable for compensation in respect of the claim made by the owner or the representative of the owner as third party claim."
8787,There is no case for either the plaintiff or the first defendant that it does not start from Kodappadimala nor is there any case that it does not flow alons the eastern boundary of Velayudhan's property.

8793,"It has been contended that after calculating the number of vacancies in the IPS, it was announced that appointments would be made in 54 vacancies of general category, and steps for recruitment were accordingly taken."
8794,The principles stated in the case of 1916-I KB 595 have been applied in India also.
8795,"The requests were made to the NAAC for making inspection and granting such certificate by the concerned institutions intending to enhance the intake capacity, however, that did not warrant derecognization of the entire college."

8797,"v. Ram Narayan Das,(1) which was also a case of a probationer."
8798,"In other words it was submitted that opportunity to enter into advantageous relationship with Government is nothing but a privilege, and a denial of a privilege for any reason whatsoever, cannot be attended with civil consequences."
8799,"The remaining four, including the appellants Sadhu Singh and Kundan Singh, are not related to the other three and, except for the evidence that they belong to the same party, are not shown to have any common interest with the other three."

8801,"Both these views came up for consideration before . Division Bench of this Court in M. Krishna Swamy v. Assam Tea Depot., 1877 Lab IC 432."
8802,"There Jack, J. held that taking the goods by a longer route, unless it was unavoidable, amounted to misconduct and it was contended that what was misconduct would certainly afford evidence of negligence."
8803,"The first issue raises the question whether the undertaking of the Company had been transferred to the Corporation and, if so, whether the settlement- of August 25, 1965 between the Company and the Union was binding on the Corporation."
8804,"For such purpose, the guiding factors would be the nature of the weapon used, the place where the injuries were inflicted, the nature of the injuries caused and the opportunity available which the accused gets."

""........... Major portion of goods purchased by petitioner and brought to their place of business at Bangalore is re-exported to persons outside the Corporation limit of Bangalore and outside the State of Karnataka."
8806,"So also it is difficult to understand how the decision of the Karnataka University not to recognise the first year B.Sc. examination of the Rajasthan and Udaipur Universities as eqivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore could be regarded as arbitrary or fanciful."
8807,This is also the view taken by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Jaladu's case (ILR (1913) 36 Mad 453).
8808,"It has been stated that, in the said list that has been published the petitioner's name appears against serial No. 341 against his registration No. M/CAC-832."
8809,"As stated above, one of the main arguments advanced by the learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the Department before us was that the word ""expenditure"" in Section 37(1) connotes ""what is paid out"" and that which has gone irretrievably."
8810,"As 1 mentioned earlier, this stand is not accepted by Mr. Surianarayana lyer, and the other learned counsel appearing for the petitioners."
8811,Nevertheless the Petitioner's request cannot be granted since the law governing the matter clearly prohibits the granting of such a petition in the face of such connivance and delay as has taken place in this case.
8812,"The learned Judges further stated at page 135:---
 ""In our opinion the combined effect of Section 28(3) and Section 5(7-C) of the Indian Income-tax Act is that the succeeding income-tax officer has a authority to pass an order upon the explanation of the assesee produced before his predecessor in office, if the assessee had failed to exercise his right under Section 5(7-C) demanding that the proceedings should be reopened."

8815,"It is further held by the Tribunal that the deceased would have received take-home pay Rs. 2,000 per month and he would have spent Rs. 1,500 for the family expenses and Rs. 500 towards his personal expenses."
8816,"Mr. Nanavati supported this argument by drawing our attention to the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses Dharamshi, Bhikha and Premji Prag on behalf of the accused."
8817,"The appellant cannot by any stretch of imagination be supposed to have committed embezzlement, fraud or foregery and he accepted the amount of Rs. 2,100/- from the Girijan Co-operative Corporation after disclosing his identity that he is the person in-charge for conducting the course for the Productivity Council."

8821,"However, as noticed by the Division Bench in KMP Timbers & Saw Mills case [(2012) 50 VST 195 (Ker)], the same would be possible only in assessment proceedings and that too on the basis of materials evidencing such practice of under-valuation and consequent suppression of turnover."
8822,"In the same case Krishna Iyer, J. with whom Bhagwati, J. agreed in his concurring judgment has summed up the true legal position under Article 74 and Article 163 of the Constitution at SCR page 875 thus : (SCC p. 885, para 154)"

19."
8828,"It was contended that the said notification was issued in public interest in view of the peculiar position; and that while the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are fully developed States, on the other hand, Punjab is comparatively a backward State in industry."

8830,"Wanchoo J., delivered a separate dissenting judgment."
8831,Issue no. 5 and 6 are also decided against the plaintiff.

8835,It is not a strange in India to find nomaders living in tents with families by the side of a street.
8836,"In reference of the judgment above, it become clear that revision of result may not necessarily oust the candidates already appointed, if they are going out of merit list but aforesaid cannot be a rigid formula in view of the ratio propounded by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case supra itself."

8840,The railway receipt in the present case is in the name of the plaintiff as the consignee.
8841,"At this point, it would be apt to clarify that in view of the non-obstante clause, the compounding of offences under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is controlled by Section 147 and the scheme contemplated by Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [Hereinafter `CrPC'] will not be applicable in the strict sense since the latter is meant for the specified offences under the Indian Penal Code."
