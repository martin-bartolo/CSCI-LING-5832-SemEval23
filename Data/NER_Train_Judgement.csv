7998,"It is not necessary for the purpose of these petitions to consider whether placing of Mr. Hanumanthappa in such additional charge, is referable to Rule 32 of the Mysore Civil Services Rules and whether what is stated in para 3 of the Official Memorandum dated 16-5-1963 (Ex. C) is applicable to Mr. Hanumanthappa holding such additional charge."
7999,"But this is not the only course open and having regard to the nature of offence and other circumstances when the court feels that quashing of proceedings cannot be in the interest of justice, it is open to the court to make appropriate orders, including fixing the period for completion of trial; (viii) it is neither advisable nor feasible to prescribe any outer time-limit for conclusion of all criminal proceedings."

8007,In the report it was also mentioned that the PMR shows that Raishuddin had suffered abrasions all over his body and only one lacerated wound was there in his entire body that too in his hand which substantiates the point that death took place due to loss of blood after the cutting of the hand in an accident caused by rickshaw carrying steel sheets and not by the car.
8008,"

 The findings recorded above clearly show that it is not that the plaintiff was sleeping over the matter."
8009,It is held that the Collector is not 'Court' and the provisions of Section 4 to Section 24 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable to the proceedings under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act under which the Collector exercises powers for making reference to the Court.
8010,"He deposed that on 28.2.2006, Delhi Police came at the said place and he was removed from the said pit at about 3.30 or 4 PM and at that time his hands and legs were tied."

15."
8016,"While considering the case of Santosh Devi, the Apex Court did not feel to refer the matter to a Larger Bench."

 Without prejudice to our above contentions, and reserving our right to take such action as may be deemed necessary in respect of the unmaintainability of the claims, We hereby nominate Shri R. M. Ray, Sr. D. G. M., Bhilai Steel Plant as our arbitrator.""

8019,"In Swastik Oil Mills v. H. B. Munshi, AIR 1968 SC 843 the Supreme Court said that as no period of limitation was prescribed by Section 22 of the Bombay Act 5 of 1946 and Section 31 of Act 3 of 1953 for exercising the power of revision the court cannot imply a period of limitation."

8023,This arbitrary classification of putting the lawyers under the head of 'commercial activity' deserves to be struck down asviolativeof Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
8024,The Tribunal disposed of these issues together holding that the agricultural land in dispute and the Muafi belong to the Dera but the building situate in Patti Sujja mentioned at Serial No. 337 of Schedule I of the Act is the property of Gurdwara Sahib Dera Patti Sujja.

8031,""" The principle in that case was sought to be stretched here beyond limits of what was stated there, to a case of promissory note too on the ground that whatever may be the reason which invalidated the promissory note, still the right to recover the money is not lost."
8032,"The Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals), Chandigarh, accepted the assessed's contention that in view of the fact that the market value of the flats in 24, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, was available, there was no justification for not adopting the same in the case of the assessed and resorting to the market value in the case of 24, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi, as done by the Income-tax Officer."
8033,"Black in his book on 'Judgments' (as quoted in the same decision) defined a judgment as ""the determination or sentence of the law pronounced by a competent Judge or Court as the result of an action or proceeding instituted in such Court affirming that upon the matters submitted for decision a legal duty or liability does or does not exist."

8039,"The expression "" current repairs "" was construed by the Allahabad High Court in Ramkishan Sunderlal v. CIT [1952] 19 ITR 324, as petty recurring expenditure."
8040,"Hence, the phrase ""he has regularly appeared as member of a trade union for no less than seven years in the proceedings"", used in Section 9(2)(b), in context of other provisions of the BIR Act, would mean that the person must have appeared and conducted regularly some cases as a representative of the employees before the Labour Court, the Industrial Court or the Tribunal for not less than seven years."
8041,"In fact, if ad hoc multipliers like 26, etc., are used for pre-14.11.1994 accidents and only maximum multiplier of 18 as per the Table is bound to be used for post-14.11.1994 accidents, there will be undue overpayment in regard to accidents prior to 14.11.1994, i.e., in the seventies or eighties, when survival rates were far less than in 1994."

8770,"As noted by me earlier, the first proviso to section 147 can be resorted to only if the assessee has not discharged the duty."
8771,It therefore emerges that non-compliance of these provisions i.e. Sections 100 and 165 CrPC would amount to an irregularity and the effect of the same on the main case depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
8772,"Nevertheless if precedent is needed for the proposition, it is available in the authoritative exposition by Subba Rao J. (as his Lordship then was) after an exhaustive discussion in CIT v. Malayalam Plantations Ltd. [1964] 53 ITR 140 (SC) in the following terms (p. 150):"
8773,"In Hamsa Vs.  Ibrahim (1994(1) Crimes 395 (Kerala) case,  it  has been held by Justice K.T.Thomas as follows:-

8776,"Equally important is the deplorable condition, verging on the inhuman, of our sub-jails, that the unrewarding cruelty and expensive custody of avoidable incarceration makes refusal of bail unreasonable and a policy favouring release justly sensible."

State of Punjab, 1998(4) RCR (Criminal) 552 (SC)."
8778,"In the assessment of compensation, there is likely to be some margin of error."
8779,"The rule, however, is not a universal one and under certain circumstances, such an amendment may be allowed by the court notwithstanding the law of limitation."

8784,"Amongst the matters covered by Section 6 (2) is the levy and collection of royalties, fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated or collected."
8785,"On the other hand, it was urged by learned counsel for the petitioner with reference to the sentence."
8786,"However, learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon decision reported in 2008 (3) TAC page 483 in which the question for consideration was whether Insurance Company is liable for compensation in respect of the claim made by the owner or the representative of the owner as third party claim."

8806,"So also it is difficult to understand how the decision of the Karnataka University not to recognise the first year B.Sc. examination of the Rajasthan and Udaipur Universities as eqivalent to the Pre-University Examination of the Pre-University Education Board, Bangalore could be regarded as arbitrary or fanciful."
8807,This is also the view taken by the Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Jaladu's case (ILR (1913) 36 Mad 453).

8821,"However, as noticed by the Division Bench in KMP Timbers & Saw Mills case [(2012) 50 VST 195 (Ker)], the same would be possible only in assessment proceedings and that too on the basis of materials evidencing such practice of under-valuation and consequent suppression of turnover."
