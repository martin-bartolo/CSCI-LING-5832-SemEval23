Whether Approved for Reporting: Yes
==================================================
Law Laid Down:
      The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 being the Central Legislation does
not contemplate grant of fitness certificate and it is left to be framed by
the State Government, therefore, the issue of fitness certificate and
payment of tax falls within the legislative competence of the State in
terms of Section 65(2)(d) of the Act of 1988 and under Section 3 of the
M.P. Motoryan Karadhan Adhiniyam, 1991. Thus, Sub-Rule (2) of
Rule 48 of the M.P. Motor Vehicles Rules, 1994 contemplating
requirement of no dues certificate for grant of fitness certificate, cannot
be said to be beyond the legislative competence of the State
Government.
      There is a presumption that the official acts are performed
regularly in terms of Sub-section (e) of Section 114 of the Evidence
Act and so is the presumption of correctness of information available
on the website. Hence, the web portal of the Department should have
entire data of tax paid of each of the vehicle. Further, the aggrieved
person should be given an option of submitting online request to
reconcile such payment. The State Government to make such
amendment in the software.
Significant Paragraph Nos. 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17
